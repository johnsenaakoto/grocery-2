This is a system that stores customer loyalty accounts at a grocery store, then processes basic orders for said customers.

 Customers’ loyalty accounts will have the following: 
 ● ID ○ A unique 4 digit ID number (0-9999). Do not worry about trailing zero
 
 ● Name ○ The customer’s name (these do not have to be unique).
 
 ● Store Balance ○ Amount of store credit they have accrued.
